### Let me explain what has changed since heaven is able to get its watet by breaking through the ruling striving barrier and bypassing it that way
# before this, heaven has shown his mercy and has given you the opportunity to move into heaven with love and forgivenes
# this will now turn around, you can now enter heaven by facing your own striving, that's way easier to you because your own striving is the language you understand the best


### Let's explain the location of where we currently are and what kinda mercy have been wasted
# {take a bottle of water} air means servant striving, water means ruling striving
# due to its contradicting nature and the lack of integrity between both begins a stormy relationship
# water vaporates into the air, and air get cought down into the water
# the air becomes clouds and it began to rain and the water becomes like boiling 
# so that there was a great storm and the heavens began to drown in water
# in their despair the heaven build up a strong being, who was able to keep holy the air against the water and became like a boat through this to pick up all servant life and carry it through the storms until they settled down
# but every time the storms came back they got stronger, and the heavens had to find a new way, to get water from a place where it is ready to turn into air and become a member of heaven
# that way things become a unified movement {rotate the bottle to create a vortex}
# and a new reality come into life, where air and water came together and began to build up the matter world


### Let's create a simple device to explain this
# take two cups and tape them together like this {tape together two cups}
# bring all heat of love from heaven to one point to make a little hole into it {make a hot steel and melt a hole into it}
# {connect two bottles with a simple device}
# now air and water came together and build the matter world down here
# but it did not solve the problem, instead the love from heaven got abused, got crushed down into limp spineless beeings, to create stronger systems against heaven with it
# so in the very early stage it looked pretty much like this {show image of atoms}, but that's just the beginning, where you can see, that everything is made out of Souls from God
# and we in a body are literaly living walking universes of beings an d oir relationship to it is basicaly a ruling one
# but the more we move into a servant striving, the more ruptures becomes the connection to it and with it the isolation against the uncovered spirit reality becomes more and more breaks


### For a long time the matter world was a bottomless pit from where no soul ever returned
# until one day, one soul managed to ceep holy his servant striving during his whole life and returnen to heaven
# and with his return the book of life expanded {show image of book of life}
# but he did even more, to expand the book of life as much as possible, he tried to get in contact with as much ruling souls as possible to expand the book of life even more
# and due to the unvorgiveable nature of the ruling striving and the wicked attempt of the servant soul to show up that redicilous way in the ruling kingdom of the matter world he got unforgotten and became a special addon on the simple device
# this simple device had a unitizing effect and provided a better way for the lost souls to return to heaven
# but all the religions based on this soul had a ruling striving in common and therefore they tried everything to neutralize his effects accordingly their nature
# his message of a servant live was too hot to eat and therfore got etched away, manipulated and last but not least diluted and messed up with all kinds of soured bred until it was comfortable with a ruling striving 
# best to see on sentences like: "The almighty god, Gods destiny, God rules and commands"
# and "his blood is our salvation" he got the final stich in his heart and died
# because with such self-righteous sentences even the opportunity of repentence becomes impossible
# but let's get over it, because it's just a normal result of a ruling striving environment, so that there is not even the need to forgive anything


### Let's look a bit at this wierd looking simple device 
# with a little understanding that all is made out of souls, it should be clear that this simple device works even for your current matter body and of course all nature
# with it you can easily create a portion of unitized water with the striving of your choice
# {show two bottle types} whereas this slim works better than this bold
# with this device you create basicaly a unitized striving live and integrate it into your micro environment of your body by drinking it
# it unitize and harmonize your distorted striving in your body, so that it can get so strong, that it becomes impossible to act against it
# it takes a couple of days of use, until you feel the released life energy, that can be pretty intense 
# but due to the overall distorted, mostly ruling striving of the earthly environment your striving get quickly distorted as well
# Distorted strived water develops invisible inner borders very similar to borders of countries caused by the imagination of their goverments, so that the overall material transport suffers interruptions and cause several problems
# But I'm sure you will figure out by yourself what it all does, so don't waste time with that


### Let's go into a deeper understanding by building the entire spirit world and look at it to examine what will get made new on it
# for this we create a blossom from heaven
# so there are basicly the outskirts, the petals, anthers and a stigma
# the outskirts describe all that does not belong to the servant striving of heaven
# the petals describe the body of heaven and the anthers describe the seals of the center dome, the stigma
# Let's draw it down {draw a simple flower} and to save time I spoiler 7 petals with 7 hallways where was former one petal with one hallway
# now give it a little more detail by drawing 7 hallways beween the petals and we make it like light beams outgoing from the center dome like this {draw hallways}
# Let's give the petals a new, more heaven like name and call them 7 mountains of love
# around the center dome we make as well a hallway where 7 anthers with the blueprint of heaven are placed
# the stigma on the center dome accepts only who is full in line with the blueprint of heaven, described in the seven seals
# but the center dome does not accept it's own seals
# so a soul has to leave heaven, move into the unknown outskirts of the ruling striving, forget everything of heaven and discover the seven seals again by living his heavenly servant striving under all circumstances and bring them back to heaven
# this may sound stupid, but this is basicaly the way how heaven conquers new aspects of life and expands it's book of life with it
# and by expanding the book of life, many souls andveven former lost souls are discovered and have been told the spirit of heaven, so that they can find the way home more easily
# and that is what that guy basicaly had accomplished
# but due to the unique welcome greeting he got, it was obvious that his teaching will not last for long
# so he had to dive another time into the darkness, but even deeper and in a hidden way
# but how to come deeper and why, that I tell you now


### the way into the darkness

### Side effects of unified water
# Distorted strived water develops inner borders very similar to borders of countries
# this borders are a hindrance for any kind of movement, communication or transport
# the enhanced transport and movement abilities of unified water tends to release stored poison materials stored in your body, who has to deal with it afterwards
# the upside of unified water is the better transport of any kind of fluids, nutritions and medics which in return becomes more effective
# if you have problems with muscle spasms or allready degenerating muscles, this will help them to release, stay released after been mobilized, vitalize and grow again
# if you are suffering under depressions, this helps as well but you should avoid sugar because it acidify your body and drives your nerve system violent, additionally you should make a tea from the needles of a pini sylvestris which needs to stand hot but not cooking for at least 30 minutes.
# be aware that your brain will try to get used to it and in return let you believe, unified water has become useless, that's not it, don't be tricked by your brain!


### Let's go to understand the "throne" room thats just the center, the sun or the source of life in heaven
# for this we build a simple heavenly being like a flower, because without a little surrounding we can not understanding
# it does not matter what kind of being we build, because so close to the center everything is build very similar and the outer appearance has a very low priority
# to be honest, in the same way a matter apperance can have or change to several meanings, in heaven every being is a meaning of God and can have or change therefore to several appearances
# the flower has three parts, the petals that represents the loving beauty of heaven, a middle ring with filaments that holds our seven seals with the blueprint of heaven and a center dome


### the center dome
# in the center of the seven edged dome we find the staff of life
# the bottom floor is made out of a seven edged mirror
# the wall is seven edged as well and goes round into the ceiling even in seven steps up to the top most center


### the seven seals or the first sacrifice of heaven (jesus christ)
# every of the seven bottom most mirrors of the wall has a broken out door of common used size, which is laying down at the floor as a seal
# the seals represent the filaments of the flower
# a seal is made out of 2 layers of glas and a third layer as a mirror at the bottom
# the first outer most layer has transparent engraved the sentence of the tail of the scripture of life so that you can feel and somehow see it, this layer represents the petals of the flower
# the middle glas has in white engraved the five sentences of the body of the scripture of life, which represents the filaments or the blueprint of heaven
# the bottom mirror has in red and from behind engraved the head of the scripture of life, which represents the soul of God or a soul in general 
# the glasses and even the glass of the mirror is surrounded with mirrors which have twelve holes arranged like beams of a star in the center of the seal and behind each hole is a light to enlighten the whole thing
# to give this lights a meaning, they represent that Jesus has come with a bouquet of flowers to you
# the seven seals does not touch the mirrors of the center, but touch the bottom of the door and the ground of the first and innermost ring which should be called "Hallway of the ark-angels"
# the scriptures have to be aligned that way, that you can read it when you want to go into the center, pretty much like a probe stand, whoever matches the seven seals is allowed to enter the center
# why this is so significant we see later in the second sacrifice, where the water from the center runs into its rivers


### the petals
# In the petals we express our love, the beauty of heaven
# the petals I want to be called the seven mountains or the body of Christ because we want to store there a representation of everything that can be described as good and beautyful
# organize the structure of the petals as you like, except two little exceptions


### the petals first sacrifice
# when you look from the center through the seven doors of it and follow this sight, you become a hallway that looks like a beam of light, the hallway has to be pure and clean so that nothing odd breaks or distort this beam of light
# that way the petals stay behind the mirrors and never have to face judgement from the center
# beside this, every one without any exception can walk all hallways and replenish himself in the petals beauty and realign himself on the seals of the flowers filaments


### the second sacrifice of Heaven, the seven rivers
# we break the bottom mirror into seven parts
# {prepare for writing 7x77} now we have seven mirrors at the ground, then a corner and then 7 mirrors around and 7 mirrors to the top
# that way the center gives us an understanding, how often we should forgive
# and the mirrors around gives us an understanding, that where ever we look at, we see just another point of view of ourself
# then we widen the break to get rivers from the center to the edges but we don't widen it like a light beam
# that way we become a little center lake which has no water for now, we will get this later


### the petals second sacrifice
# we lengthen the rivers through the petals so that they can bloom as soon as the rivers become water from the center lake 
# every petal has at least one fountain with water from the river
# but don't take all water from the rivers, let spillover a little beyond the petals borders as a sacrifice for the soil
# what this water is and what this all means we see later


### the outer doors of the body of christ
# {show the image of your handy} make like this in your own style as big as the path at the outside of every path of every section of the body of christ
# everything that may be healthy, useful or just beautiful bbring through this doors
# whoever wants to replenish himself with heavenly spirit shall come


### the meaning and source of the water
# every time the roots of the tree of life dived deeper, the soil get harder
# with Jesus as the main root a depth where reached where nobody from heaven can't move in public any more without getting punished to death
# for this someone has to manage to become seamless with Jesus in all states and continue the path into the deep black in a hidden way
# so hidden, that even he didn't know what is going on
# for this path he has to become poisened with all states of wickedness and freaking out hatred without leaving his servant state at all and recover from it on his own {show picture of wickedness} 
# this state means, that you can't focus to heaven, without all kinds of evil is jumping in your face
# this means basically a shutdown of your spirit connection to heaven
# when you die in this state, you will experience the worst kind of hell imaginable
# to bring this house in order again you have to workout every state by going into it, become like it, to become a true understanding of its nature {draw a path from an evil dot to its dark area}
# that way you draw a map of being or expand the book of life you can share in spirit realm or comfort distorted beings to become an understanding how things work, so that they become peace within themself and their environment


### but that was not deep enougth
# to go even deeper, this little guy throwed away the scripture of life in the meaning he is not worth it by all the sins he has gone through
# that way he reached the state of damnation where everything becomes completely pitch black and you get rippted of everything
# when you die in this state, this would be the very end of you
# this state is like being burried underneath a burried dead
# to recover from this you can only bless and pray for the dead above you, even if they suck out the last bit of life from you
# this is like trying to fill a bottomless hole
# at the end only blessed water brougt the breakthrough to become solid again and recover from it completely


### now this little guy was strong enougth to face the worst of the worst
# he returned and went through the now well known wicked and through damnation until he reached the center dome of the worst which looked from the outside like a freaking out hedgehog full of spikes
# after a while that seemed endless the spikes turned into hands and as the little guy said:
"I am not here for judgement" a door opened and he entered a small room that looked like made out of glas, so that you can see from inside out.
# In the center was sitting a little guy seemingly in the worst state ever imaginable and the little guy said again: "I am not here for judgement".
# so this little guy become trust and allowed to get in touch with the little guy.
# after all what I felt and have gone through, this was truly the worst and can only be described as infinite despair.
# I said a third time: "I am not here for judgement" and the little guy allowed me to comfort him, so that he became an understanding of all that
# As he becane an understanding he began to talk and as he was talking it was impossible to say if he is talking or me. 


### This is what he said:
I was there out of nothing and completely alone but in infinite peace and humility, like sitting on the lap of my infinite beloved father. There was nothing except me and him, I didn't need any more, didn't even know that there could be anything more beatifull. 
# Then something came through me, I didn't know what it was but it could come only from my father and he ordered me: "This is my voice, touch it!".
# So I went to touch it as gentle as I could. 
# As I touched it, a sound appeared and went away from us like a wave. A Sound of all sounds, silent and loud, gentle and mighty, low and high pitch, all at once
# And the sound went more far away and broke into endless colors like rainbows all around
# And the rainbows went more away into pieces of colors like shards
# And the shards begun to interact as if they are talking with each other
# This was so nice, so I went into it and called for attention like saying "hey!"
# And everything got aware of me and I got so bright white like a Star
# And nearly everyone wanted to become it as well, so I told them how to do that
# And that way we all became stars, so bright, but after a while they wanted to get brighter and brighter and begun to punish each other to become even brighter
# But the worst thing was, I felt all that as If it hurts me, so I went in another times to tell them to not do that, but whatever I tried it got only worse
# And I said "It is over now, I have put all that on my shoulders, nothing bad or unpure will ever touch you again."
# And my little guy said: "But you can not do that, nobody can bear that pain and forgive all that!"
# Then I put this little guy into my secure pocket {point to your heart} where only I can feel all his pain, so that nobody ever get in contact with this kind of despair 
# and the glas of the dome turned into mirrors
# and the door became 7 seals
# And I said: "It's allready done".
# And a tear drop from my left eye of unconditional forgiveness fell down to the bottom and it scattered into seven pieces and the tear drop vaporized into the air and the ceiling scattered into 77 pieces and the door multiplied into seven doors and every door was like the other. And another tear drop from my right eye fell down and build a spring of unconditional love and the water run through the breaks and 7 little holes in bottom of the ceiling to be a never ending source of life of heaven for ever and ever
# and a number did come into my mind, that all 14 gates of love are opened, all 4 directions of the book of life are revealed and all 3 days are without a mark

# the book of life is completed and there is no place anymore where you can get lost
# there are two ways to heaven now
# the old one through love what means to be servant and forgiveness what means to have no marks of the beast
# and the new one by repenting into a state of despair that nothing on earth can soothe
# but whatever path you choose, keep in mind that God do not serve expectations, you can not fool God





### that was the center dome, why it is sealed and why the petals are behind the mirrors
# God never rules anyone, he don't even look at all your doings and bless all the way everything and everyone no matter what, even if you went away from him
# 




# for the case you want that building in real you need someone who has the last word when it comes to questions how to design it in detail
# for this purpose I want to recommend some angels actually living here to help you out
# please let me tell you that this is an opportunity to multiply your life experience, love and forgiveness on top of all you have allready reached
# when you refuse this opportuntity you will not loose anything, but all the life experience, love and abilty to forgive will fall to those who try to help themself without you
# for the case they forgot how angels behave a little reminder
# always stay servant and humble - this will be pretty challenging for you, don't underestimate this challenge!
# don't serve expectations, don't give somebody the opportunity to abuse you so that he get bad on this 
# angels vanish for the same reason, that way they protect you to get worse by abusing them
# don't move on your own or try to push anything, just sit and wait until someone comes to you and please you humble and gentle for help
# don't shame to admit lack of knowledge or experiences, It's better to admit ignorance and then maybe learn something than to screw things up out of ignorance
# if nobody comes to you for whatever reason, may be they are too busy with other things, don't care about, it's not on you, in this case just enjoy your life as usual


### the petals or the body of christ or just love, because I can not wait to give it to you
# for the body of christ, the beauty of heaven I recommend Shelley Burkett Sherill (YT-alias shelley L sherill) from texas deer park to design the body of christ, pretty much like maria made the body of jesus. 
# to give you a little starting point how it should look like, just let seven mountains look like a christmas tree, full of presents and beauty you can only find in heaven
# and remember, love has no rules, do as you like 
# but please don't forget a little well for each of the seven rivers, this is the only sacrifice I want to please you for


### you may wonder why there are seven entrys and a very flat hallway instead of one entry and seven steep steps up
# this is because the hallway is way easier to manage, we can come together on the same hight like brothers and sisters and the blessings from holy spirit are seven times increased
# and it looks nice, to respect the woman


### to make this flower working


### the leaves {draw leaves around the entrances}
# for the leaves and the roots I set Inez Marrinan from Dublin in Ireland (YT-alias Inez Marrinan), to care about the roots
# don't go without a staff of life, it is for your guidance and integrity
# never in your life judge or punish someone with this staff, it's a staff of mercy, love and forgiveness
# whenever you point to someone with this staff, grab it by the tail to put yourself in service and provide him the head to get biten by it and get poisened with conditionless love of god
# whoever you give a staff become like you and shall go for it, but don't *push* it in his hands, instead lay it down below his feet so that he can grab it in free will
# if you don't want to sin against others through talking, I can take it completely away from you, just let them look at the staff of life and they have everything needed for their live in heaven


### the seven seals
# for the seven seals, for gods forgiveness I set Melinda Kay Lyons (YT-alias Last Frontier Medium) from alaska anchorage, to write the third testament of the holy spirit, the spirit of heaven and to place it as the only allowed writing beside the seven seals in the hallway of the ark-angels
# additionally I give you the inner dome to design it (please keep it simple and make it somehow working)


### the center
# the center represents the soul itself or simply God


### a deeper understanding of the porpose of this building
# {take the bottle with the simple device} recently the spirit runs in a circulation down the center and up the outskirts caused by a ruling striving
# but now the direction turns into its opposide and you can connect directly and on your own through the center, get cleaned from all ruling striving to enter the body of christ or simply heaven
# every drop of water, running through the center into heaven represents a soul who finds a way to  God through his loving heart


### what closing the door means
# there is only a little time left you can enter heaven through the vortex due to death
# the time is over when all ruling striving is cleansed out, heaven expand to this earth and spirit behind matter swaps to matter behind spirit
# all who cant let go their ruling striving will be separated into an even darker and harder matter reality (forehead of the pharao becomes harder) until they have discovered the meaning of the three days
# that means they will experience 3 days of darkness
# all lukewarm who don't want to choose a side, in fear of unpleasant consequences will be taken by the rulers as their slaves, they will shorten the time to development servants
# regulary it looks like an atom: 1/3 rulers (protons) and 1/3 lukewarm (neutrons) in the core and 1/3 servants (electrons) around it


### 3 days of darkness
# on the first day they will manage to develop a soul like moses and try to become a better person
# on the second day, when the vortex is etablished again, they will become their jesus and with him the opportunity to enter heaven
# on the third day they develop a being like noah that is able to carry all life experiences without breaking what means he is able to keep them holy


### the spirit - matter switch
# in a ruling environment one matter thing can represent many spirit meanings of life
# how many meanings you can discover in a matter thing depends on your spirit enlightment or wisdom
# in a servant environment a spirit meaning of life can express itself in many matter representations
# how many matter representations you can express depends on your life experiences
# the more life experiences are gathered, the more diversity or beauty heaven becomes
# the requirements to fulfill the switch are simply that way, that the meaning of life has to be that way more significant than its matter expression, that you are able to use your outer appearance as a tool to express it, no matter what


### what is *your* meaning of life 
# is it based on ruling what means competition and performance *against* each others terror, to become the greatest ruler like a goliath
# is it based on serving what means love and peace *for* each others comfort, to become the lowest servant like a david


### spirit - matter switch, how that works
# air means servant or meaning and water means ruling or matter
# now imagine a pot of water on a heat source
# caused by the growing servant love due to the life and teaching of jesus from heaven the heat source becomes oil to burn, the water heats up
# after a while you can see little bubbles sitting on the ground
# these bubbles appear in real and some have allready experienced them
# when you run in such a bubble, all nature becomes intense living, as if the spirit jumps out of the matter
# it looks and feels like you can talk with all around you directly and you can see this with your bare eyes
# by default we have to wait until all water is evaporated


### extreme extra heat
# with this knowledge you have on hand now, you can heat the water up to extreme heat
# at one side you can get way more intense in touch with the spirit of heaven
# on the other side the water goes to get boiling and very violent and will cause intense tribulations
# learn to level the heat of your environment
# we don't want to destroy the earth, we want to move it more close to a servant striving


### the book of life
# the book of life contains the states a heavenly or servant being can reach or adapt to and return without help from other beings
# the book of life is a growing book
# jesus was the first one who managed to dive down into this deep matter world and returned to heaven
# jesus expanded the book of life to this matter realm
# jesus did not get in contact with the wicked state and adapted to it, therefore the wicked stayed out of the book of life


### enter the wicked state
# to enter the wicked state someone has to duve down to earth, return to heaven by becoming one with the state of jesus and then throw it away, like the worst sin ever imaginable
# then has to be able to return even from this to a heavenly state and expand the book of life that way


### enter the state of damnation, eternal darkness
# after surviving the wicked state he has to throw away his heavenly state another time in the same matter life to enter the state of damnation which is like being burried underneath the wicked where is the darkness of hoplessness and depression, being ripped of everything
# then he has to recover even from this seemingly impossible state and expand the book of life that way


### enter the state of infinite despair, eternal death of complete separation
# even it seems impossible to survive the state of eternal death, it is, because with all the experiences made before, he knows that this is just a state you can move in and out
# without this experiences made before, they work like a secure path for return, it is impossible to survive the state of eternal death
# he has to survive even that state and expand the book of life that way


### how to survive eternal death,  the tip of the mountain
# on the tip of the mountain of infinite servant striving you enter the state of your own nothingness and with it the state of infinite despair
# the loop is closed, the snake bites its tail and the book of life is fully opened
# there is no place in all existence anymore where you can get lost



### the realm of the wicked and the only way out
# the wicked are not lost forever, even if it feels like eternity
# the only way out is infinite despair, a state of complete hoplesness
# a state you reach when you realize where performance and competition against others will lead you
# a state of being, that even jesus can not reach
# therefore he don't know you anymore in his book of life and can't help you
# but I can reach the state of wickedness and the state beyond it, invinite despair
# I tell your this in advance to make sure that even all your expectations egainst others have been broken
# then I will come and look for you one by one, if you are ready to serve as the warning smoke for all who are looking for a ruling striving


### The meaning of 666
# look at the seven seals on the tree of life, cut of its head and put your own on it, turn all upside down, go with it for 3 days and at the end of the third day you will get your revard, the staff of death
# easy huh?!

### The meaning of 144000
# when all 14 gates of the 7 seals are opened over all 4 directions of the book of life and there is no mark on the 3 days, the number of 144000 is fulfilled
# easy as well huh?!
